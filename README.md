Deepfake Detection using EfficientNetB0 & Streamlit

![Deepfake Detection Output](dfd.PNG)  

This project is an AI-powered Deepfake Detection System that analyzes images and videos to determine whether they are real or fake. It uses a pre-trained EfficientNetB0 model for classification and features an intuitive **Streamlit UI** for user interaction.  

Features
‚úÖ Accepts both images (.jpg, .png) and videos (.mp4, .avi) as input.  
‚úÖ Utilizes EfficientNetB0 for deepfake classification.  
‚úÖ Frame-wise deepfake detection for videos with an average confidence score.  
‚úÖ Displays real-time predictions with confidence scores.  
‚úÖ Interactive Streamlit UI for seamless user experience.  


How It Works  

1. For Images  
   - The uploaded image is preprocessed and passed to the deepfake detection model.  
   - The model predicts whether the image is Real or Fake, along with a confidence score.  

2. For Videos 
   - Frames are extracted from the uploaded video.  
   - Each frame is analyzed using the model.  
   - The system calculates an average deepfake probability to determine if the video is Real or Fake.  

Tech Stack  
- Python  
- TensorFlow & Keras (EfficientNetB0 Model)  
- OpenCV (Image & Video Processing)  
- Streamlit (Web App Interface)  
- NumPy (Data Handling)  


Installation & Usage  

Clone the Repository  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/deepfake-detection.git
cd deepfake-detection
```

2Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Streamlit App  
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

4Ô∏è‚É£ Upload an Image or Video  
- Select Image or Video as input.  
- Upload the file, and the model will classify it as Real or Fake.  


Example Output  

![Deepfake Detection UI](dfd.PNG)  

- The uploaded image was classified as **Fake** with a confidence score of 0.55.  
- The system provides a **clear and interactive UI** for results visualization.  

üìå Future Enhancements
